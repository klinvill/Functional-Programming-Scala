# Scala-Functional-Programming

This repository holds the coursework for the Coursera course on [functional programming in Scala](https://class.coursera.org/progfun-005).

## Assignments

### Week 1 - recfun

The first assignment for the course focused on recursive functions. The assignment was composed of a series of smaller assignments that included calculating the number returned by a given row and column in Pascal's triangle, checking to make sure parentheses are balenced in a string, and counting the number of different ways you can make change for an amount given a list of coin values.

### Week 2 - funsets

This assignment consisted of making a functional representation of a Set. This included implementing basic set operations including union, intersection, and difference. The goal of this assignment was to practice with higher-order functions.

### Week 3 - objsets

Unlike the previous week's assignment that focused on a functional representation of a set, this week's assignment focused on building an object-oriented representation of an ordered set with an underlying binary tree implementation. In this case, the set was a set of tweets. The final part of the assignment involved figuring out which tweets were trending for a specific topic (in this case google or apple).

### Week 4 - patmat

Week 4's assignment was about making a functional representation of a Huffman tree and to implement encoding and decoding.

### Week 5 

There was no assignment this week.

### Week 6 - forcomp

This week's assignment involved computing all potential collections of words given a dictionary and a set of characters. The objective of the assignment was to get practice with the Scala Collections API and for-comprehensions.

### Week 7 - streams

The final assignment focused on implementing a solver for a simple Bloxorz game using streams and lazy evaluation.
